# Decentracar

This is a demo application showing you how a share-economy car company might take advantage of a fast DLT. 

You can read more about that here: https://www.tupelo.org/posts/decentracar and here: https://www.tupelo.org/posts/dlt-isnt-disintermediation

This is a simulation. We use the *actual testnet* for this simulation to show how a system like this could actually work.

In your browser, there is a Decentracar company approving riders and drivers. The drivers and riders than communicate over p2p pubsub and use tupelo chaintrees in order to register things like location, and that they have agreed upon pickup/drop off. The visualization is pretty simple and just shows you the cars and drivers working together.
